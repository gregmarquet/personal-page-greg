      <h2>My story</h2>
      <p>Grew up in Paris, France. Spent a good amount of my vacations in Roscoff, Brittany where I ate the best crêpes in the world. </p>
      <p> Realized I could change people's mood through physical comedy. Ran away and joined the Circus. Was told that I was tall and a little old so it would be hard. Worked super hard, ate a lot of pasta. Did the double backflip in my second year. </p>
      <p>Created an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV1S91q5Vpo" target="_blank">acrobatic act</a> with 2 close friends.  Toured the US in 1999 with Barnum's Kaleidoscape. Learned Italian while teaching acrobatics. Ate the best home-made pasta to date.</p>
      <p>Went back to Europe to tour the varieties in Germany. Learned enough German to survive. Discovered the great Russian writers. Learned Balalaika with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPX6smfxaRY" target="_blank">Micha the great</a>.</p>
      <p>Came to Seattle for a three month contract with <a href="http://zinzanni.com/seattle/" target="_blank">Teatro Zinzanni</a>. This contract turned into a ten year long adventure. Performed in front of a million spectators. Learned a lot about customer satisfaction. Fell in love at first sight with an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifersipila" target="_blank">amazing woman</a>. Moved back and forth between Seattle and San Francisco. Got married on two different continents with the same amazing woman.</p>
      <p>Became an Art agent to promote my <a href="http://www.davidsongalleries.com/artists/contemporary/jean-luc-le-balp/" target="_blank">friend's work</a>. Became an American. Yeah! Read a book a week for a year. Read even more now that I stopped counting.</p>
      <p>Realized I could change people's life through technology and entrepreneurship. Discovered the work of Steve Blank and Eric Ries. Moved to New York to join a growing and exciting startup scene. Studied design and front-end development at General Assembly, wanted more, studied full-stack developement at the Flatiron School. Now ready to change the world through technology!</p>
